                            <h3>Is ordering through Deliveroo safe?</h3>
                            <p>Our absolute priority is to offer the safest service possible to customers, riders and restaurants and we have taken a number of important actions to ensure we deliver food safely for everyone. For example, we have introduced contact-free delivery, guidelines for restaurants on how to run delivery-only kitchens hygienically and guidance for riders on safe and secure delivery. We are in daily contact with local health officials to make sure we are offering customers, restaurants and riders the most up-to-date guidance and safest service possible. It’s also important to note that the European Food Safety Authority has said that there is “no evidence that food is a likely source or route of transmission of the virus”. We realise this is a concerning period for everyone and want to assure you that safety is our priority during and beyond this unprecedented time</p>
                            <h3>How does contact-free delivery work?</h3>
                            <p>Customers can choose ‘Contact-free delivery’ at check-out. Riders will be able to see when a customer has selected this option in the order’s delivery notes and will then follow a simple process to ensure there is no contact when the food is delivered. </p>
                            <p>Riders will be asked to let the customer know they have arrived, place the order outside their door, step a safe distance back and wait nearby for the customer to collect the food before the order can be completed. Riders are also able to make orders contact-less if they wish by letting customers know through the app before they arrive. </p>
                            <h3>How are you supporting riders?</h3>
                            <p>Since the outbreak of COVID-19 we have and continue to do everything we can to help riders:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Up-to-date guidance: Extensive hygiene guidance and updates are available on the rider website, as well as the latest information from the Government on how self-employed people like riders can access additional financial support.</li>
                                <li>Deliveroo’s Rider Support Fund: If a rider who regularly works with Deliveroo does experience symptoms of COVID-19 or is told to self-isolate by a medical authority, they can also apply for financial help through our Rider Support Fund.</li>
                                <li>Contact-free pick up & delivery: We’ve introduced contact-free pick up and delivery across the UK which means riders can work without coming into direct contact with restaurant staff or customers.</li>
                                <li>Free products: Riders can apply for a payment of up to £20 to cover the purchase of hygiene products like hand sanitiser or face masks while we work to secure our own supply.</li>
                                <li>Support from restaurants: We have asked all of our restaurant partners to provide riders with access to soap and water or hand sanitising gel at their property whenever possible.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <h3>How are you supporting restaurants?</h3>
                            <p>We are here to deliver for restaurants who want to carry on offering their amazing food to families at home during this difficult time. We are working with restaurants to optimise their operations for delivery, and we are doing everything we can to make sure people still have access to the food they want and need. <br> We have:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Published detailed guidance on how restaurants can run delivery-only outlets safely, covering issues such as how to minimise contact, packaging and hygiene best practice.</li>
                                <li>Developed bespoke online marketing support for restaurants to let customers know they are operating delivery services</li>
                                <li>Established teams of people across the business to recruit and support restaurants who want to be able to deliver food.</li>
                                <li>Lowered onboarding fees for new restaurants</li>
                                <li>Developed an app to introduce ‘contact-free delivery’ so that restaurants can give confidence to consumers that delivery is conducted safely</li>
                                <li>Shared expert advice and guidance on how to operate safely during the outbreak</li>
                                <li>Campaigned for more support for restaurants from government </li>

                            <h3>Is ordering through Deliveroo safe?</h3>
                            <p>Our absolute priority is to offer the safest service possible to customers, riders and restaurants and we have taken a number of important actions to ensure we deliver food safely for everyone. For example, we have introduced contact-free delivery, guidelines for restaurants on how to run delivery-only kitchens hygienically and guidance for riders on safe and secure delivery. We are in daily contact with local health officials to make sure we are offering customers, restaurants and riders the most up-to-date guidance and safest service possible. It’s also important to note that the European Food Safety Authority has said that there is “no evidence that food is a likely source or route of transmission of the virus”. We realise this is a concerning period for everyone and want to assure you that safety is our priority during and beyond this unprecedented time</p>
                            <h3>How does contact-free delivery work?</h3>
                            <p>Customers can choose ‘Contact-free delivery’ at check-out. Riders will be able to see when a customer has selected this option in the order’s delivery notes and will then follow a simple process to ensure there is no contact when the food is delivered. </p>
                            <p>Riders will be asked to let the customer know they have arrived, place the order outside their door, step a safe distance back and wait nearby for the customer to collect the food before the order can be completed. Riders are also able to make orders contact-less if they wish by letting customers know through the app before they arrive. </p>
                            <h3>How are you supporting riders?</h3>
                            <p>Since the outbreak of COVID-19 we have and continue to do everything we can to help riders:</p>

                                <li>Contact-free pick up & delivery: We’ve introduced contact-free pick up and delivery across the UK which means riders can work without coming into direct contact with restaurant staff or customers.</li>

                            <h3>Is ordering through Deliveroo safe?</h3>
                            <p>Our absolute priority is to offer the safest service possible to customers, riders and restaurants and we have taken a number of important actions to ensure we deliver food safely for everyone. For example, we have introduced contact-free delivery, guidelines for restaurants on how to run delivery-only kitchens hygienically and guidance for riders on safe and secure delivery. We are in daily contact with local health officials to make sure we are offering customers, restaurants and riders the most up-to-date guidance and safest service possible. It’s also important to note that the European Food Safety Authority has said that there is “no evidence that food is a likely source or route of transmission of the virus”. We realise this is a concerning period for everyone and want to assure you that safety is our priority during and beyond this unprecedented time</p>
                            <h3>How does contact-free delivery work?</h3>
                            <p>Customers can choose ‘Contact-free delivery’ at check-out. Riders will be able to see when a customer has selected this option in the order’s delivery notes and will then follow a simple process to ensure there is no contact when the food is delivered. </p>
                            <p>Riders will be asked to let the customer know they have arrived, place the order outside their door, step a safe distance back and wait nearby for the customer to collect the food before the order can be completed. Riders are also able to make orders contact-less if they wish by letting customers know through the app before they arrive. </p>
                            <h3>How are you supporting riders?</h3>
                            <p>Since the outbreak of COVID-19 we have and continue to do everything we can to help riders:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Up-to-date guidance: Extensive hygiene guidance and updates are available on the rider website, as well as the latest information from the Government on how self-employed people like riders can access additional financial support.</li>
                                <li>Deliveroo’s Rider Support Fund: If a rider who regularly works with Deliveroo does experience symptoms of COVID-19 or is told to self-isolate by a medical authority, they can also apply for financial help through our Rider Support Fund.</li>
                                <li>Contact-free pick up & delivery: We’ve introduced contact-free pick up and delivery across the UK which means riders can work without coming into direct contact with restaurant staff or customers.</li>
                                <li>Free products: Riders can apply for a payment of up to £20 to cover the purchase of hygiene products like hand sanitiser or face masks while we work to secure our own supply.</li>
                                <li>Support from restaurants: We have asked all of our restaurant partners to provide riders with access to soap and water or hand sanitising gel at their property whenever possible.</li>

                            <h3>Is ordering through Deliveroo safe?</h3>
                            <p>Our absolute priority is to offer the safest service possible to customers, riders and restaurants and we have taken a number of important actions to ensure we deliver food safely for everyone. For example, we have introduced contact-free delivery, guidelines for restaurants on how to run delivery-only kitchens hygienically and guidance for riders on safe and secure delivery. We are in daily contact with local health officials to make sure we are offering customers, restaurants and riders the most up-to-date guidance and safest service possible. It’s also important to note that the European Food Safety Authority has said that there is “no evidence that food is a likely source or route of transmission of the virus”. We realise this is a concerning period for everyone and want to assure you that safety is our priority during and beyond this unprecedented time</p>
                            <h3>How does contact-free delivery work?</h3>
                            <p>Customers can choose ‘Contact-free delivery’ at check-out. Riders will be able to see when a customer has selected this option in the order’s delivery notes and will then follow a simple process to ensure there is no contact when the food is delivered. </p>
                            <p>Riders will be asked to let the customer know they have arrived, place the order outside their door, step a safe distance back and wait nearby for the customer to collect the food before the order can be completed. Riders are also able to make orders contact-less if they wish by letting customers know through the app before they arrive. </p>
                            <h3>How are you supporting riders?</h3>
                            <p>Since the outbreak of COVID-19 we have and continue to do everything we can to help riders:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Up-to-date guidance: Extensive hygiene guidance and updates are available on the rider website, as well as the latest information from the Government on how self-employed people like riders can access additional financial support.</li>
                                <li>Deliveroo’s Rider Support Fund: If a rider who regularly works with Deliveroo does experience symptoms of COVID-19 or is told to self-isolate by a medical authority, they can also apply for financial help through our Rider Support Fund.</li>
                                <li>Contact-free pick up & delivery: We’ve introduced contact-free pick up and delivery across the UK which means riders can work without coming into direct contact with restaurant staff or customers.</li>
                                <li>Free products: Riders can apply for a payment of up to £20 to cover the purchase of hygiene products like hand sanitiser or face masks while we work to secure our own supply.</li>
                                <li>Support from restaurants: We have asked all of our restaurant partners to provide riders with access to soap and water or hand sanitising gel at their property whenever possible.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <h3>How are you supporting restaurants?</h3>

                                <li>Developed bespoke online marketing support for restaurants to let customers know they are operating delivery services</li>
                                <li>Established teams of people across the business to recruit and support restaurants who want to be able to deliver food.</li>
                                <li>Lowered onboarding fees for new restaurants</li>
                                <li>Developed an app to introduce ‘contact-free delivery’ so that restaurants can give confidence to consumers that delivery is conducted safely</li>
                                <li>Shared expert advice and guidance on how to operate safely during the outbreak</li>
                                <li>Campaigned for more support for restaurants from government </li>
